This app consists of an Angular 4 front-end to query and edit an PostGreSQL database through a Node JS backend. The DellStore normal sample database has been chosen from the website https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sample_Databases. These databases are provided for developers to get practice with using PostGres and in this case I have used it to create an entire app with Sequelize as the ORM to define PostGres database models.
